**Two Sumüéè**<br>

Leet code link: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/ <br>

I have written 3 solutions for the same problem with three different time complexities. <br> <br>  

**O(n^2) or Quadratic time**<br>
This is a simple solution that uses the Brute Force method to check every possible pair in an array to find the target solution.<br>
The outer loop compares each element to the rest of the n-1 elements thus time complexity is O(n^2).
